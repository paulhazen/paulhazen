## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Thank you for visiting my code samples!

I'm currently a Senior studying Computer Science and Machine Learning at DigiPen Institute of Technology.
Below are some curated examples of code that I have written and projects I have had the privilege of working on

## Source Code Samples

#### Monty-Hall (Rust):

Here is a cool project that I can share, a nice self-contained one. You've heard of the [[Monty-Hall problem]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) right? Of course you have, I knew you were a smart cookie. Well this is a very quick n' dirty program that simulates that problem being played a bunch of times, demonstrating that switching your door is the best way to find the goat.

#### Chess Data Parsing (Python):

This is a function that I extracted with permission from a project I worked on at DigiPen. The intent was to create a neural network that had a neuron for each place on a chess board. We then took as much data as we could find about chess matches, and ran them through our model.

IIRC, this particular function helps to extract some of the meta-data about board state; but it's a good example of well-documented python code that (hopefully) won't put you to sleep while reading, and it shows my thought process a bit.

#### Quicksort (C++):

Due to their nature as academic projects, most of the interesting things I do I can't share here, so here's a quicksort implementation that's like all the other ones you've ever seen. It's not interesting. I should really come up with something cute to use as an example - maybe I'll make a tic-tac-toe game or something over the next weekend.
